# Sindi
Sindi is a lightweight library easing the configuration and design of [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) applications in a safe way.

The library is composed of two independent modules:

 * __sindi-core__: [IoC](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) container with a static binding process (using compile-time implicits resolution) 
 * __sindi-config__: Safe configuration system integrating the [typesafe-config](http://github.com/typesafehub/config) library
 
You'll find more information on the website, and support on the dedicated mailing list:
