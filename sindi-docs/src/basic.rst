Introduction
============

Welcome to the Sindi IoC Container official documentation!

This guide will explain you what you can achieve with Sindi and how to do so,
but it won't explain you why/how using IoC to achieve a well crafted modular architecture.

If your looking for an introduction to IoC, here is some resources that might be of interest to you:
 * `Inversion of Control <http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html>`_
 * `IoC and the DI pattern <http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html>`_

If you already know an other IoC/DI framework,
you should keep in mind that Sindi take a different approach than other traditional frameworks.

In this regards please take a look at the wiki page
"`How does Sindi compare with X? <http://github.com/aloiscochard/sindi/wiki/Comparison>`_" before continuing your reading here.
